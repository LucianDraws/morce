Short codes that will input a string using only alphabetical characters (upper and lower case), numbers, commas, periods and question mark, and returns a representation of the string in Morse code. The Morse code output should consist of a dash (-, ASCII 0x2D) for a long beep (AKA 'dah') and a dot (., ASCII 0x2E) for short beep (AKA 'dit').

Each letter should be separated by a space (' ', ASCII 0x20), and each word should be separated by a forward slash (/, ASCII 0x2F).
